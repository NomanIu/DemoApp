This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Information about implementation

### Header

- We created our custom header by placing left Icon, Title and user image in a single row bu using flex-direction

### Segment control

- We created segment control by placing multiple views in a single row

### Content type 

- We created content selection with the help of flex-Wrap and placing them on top of each other while giving user the functionality to select from the given content types.

### Dropdown

- We created our drop down with the help of @react-native-picker/picker. It allows users to select from a range of existing options.

### Slider with indicator

- We created our slider with the help of @react-native-community/slider. After slider we added custom indicator on top of it to show the updated slider value to our users.

### Button

- We created our custom button with the help of custom views.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
